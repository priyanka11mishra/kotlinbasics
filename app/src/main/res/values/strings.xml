When you run the app, this image, unlike the star, will scroll out of view as the text scrolls up.  Hint: You will need to wrap the two scrollable views into a LinearLayout inside the ScrollView. ScrollView > LinerLayout > ImageView + TextView  Below is a skeleton code version for this challenge.  The important thing to remember is that since ScrollView can only have one child, you have to wrap that ImageView and the TextView into a LinearLayout.  There is no solution code provided for this challenge, but the skeleton code below gives you the expected view hierarchy to use.]]></string>
